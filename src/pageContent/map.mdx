import BlogMap from "../components/blogMap";

I made a map that charts out all of my updates with markers (the little green dots). You can zoom in and click on any of them to go to their corresponding blog post.

<BlogMap />

I made this map using [React Simple Maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/). More information on how I implemented it can be seen here (soonâ„¢).
