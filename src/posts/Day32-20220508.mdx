## Memorable moments from today
- I woke up last night with a tender foot that I was afraid could be the start of a gout attack. It was slightly swollen and hurt when I pressed on it. I've been taking preventative medicine for gout for a few years now (I had a bad genetic draw for high uric acid levels), but I didn't want to take the risk of it becoming a full-blown attack on the trail. If it was an actual attack, I wouldn't be able to put any weight on my foot and someone would have to carry me miles to the nearest road.
- Out of an abundance of caution, I called for a shuttle at Indian Grave Gap. Doug, the shuttle driver, picked me up and brought me to an urgent care clinic in Erwin.
- I was able to see a doctor at the urgent care. She gave me a steroid shot and some colchicine to stop the attack if I was having one. 
- Thankfully, my foot didn't seem to be getting any worse and I was able to walk to a nearby Taco Bell to get food, then to the hotel nearby to get a room for the night.
- Not to much happened after that. I just chilled in the hotel room and monitored my foot. It seemed to be getting a bit better, and I felt confident that I would be able to hike tomorrow. I called Doug and scheduled a pick up tomorrow morning back to Indian Grave Gap.
- I think going back to Erwin was the right call, because as I said before, getting a gout attack on trail would be absolutely terrible. However, as I laid in the hotel room alone I had the urge to get back on the trail. The sense of purpose, mental clarity, and peace that I get when I'm hiking towards Katahdin is something that I have grown to long for.
