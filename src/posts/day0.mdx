This is the first preemptive blog post for my Appalachian Trail thru-hike (to test the functionality of the site).

I'll be starting at [Amicalola Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicalola_Falls_State_Park) on March 22, 2022. [Springer Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Mountain), which is about 8 miles north, is the actual start of the AT. But I want to hike the [approach trail](https://appalachiantrail.org/official-blog/14-reasons-to-start-your-northbound-thru-hike-at-amicalola-falls-state-park/) because it looks like fun and I want a picture under the famous archway.

You can see the marker for this blog post on the map on the [Appalachian Trail](/appalachian_trail) of my site.

I'll try my best to have a blog post for every day of my hike, no matter the quality or quantity of the post.
