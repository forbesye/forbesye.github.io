Phew it's been a while since I've updated this website.

I did finish the Appalachian Trail! See the attached photo of me at Katahdin as some proof. I also did track every day with my Garmin watch and uploaded it to my [Strava account](https://www.strava.com/activities/7847108743).

Apologies for not posting any blog updates since I was in Virginia. Thru-hiking is a hard endeavor and at the end of most days I just wanted to eat dinner and sleep. I'm going to try my best to backfill posts with all the photos that I took, and memories of the day if I can recall any.
